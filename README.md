## üõë The Problem

**Promoters are stuck in cash flow hell.**

### The Promoter's Nightmare

- **You need $100k upfront** for venue deposits, artist advances, and production costs
- **Ticket revenue is locked** by ticketing platforms until after the show
- **You're forced to borrow** at high interest rates or risk losing the event
- **If tickets don't sell out**, you lose everything while platforms keep their fees

### The Broken System

- **Ticketing platforms** hold your money hostage for months
- **Fans can't help** even if they desperately want the show to happen
- **All risk falls on you** while platforms capture value without risk
- **No way to validate demand** before committing massive capital

### The Result

**Promoters go broke, fans miss out, and ticketing platforms get rich.**

## üí° Solution: Fanio

Fanio turns every event into a liquid digital asset through crowdfunding campaigns.

### How It Works

1. **Campaign Creation**: Promoter creates a campaign with target amount in base currency (e.g., USDC)
2. **Fan Funding**: Fans contribute base currency to reach the target, receiving EventTokens 1:1
3. **Campaign Success**: If target is reached, promoter gets full funding upfront
4. **Automatic Liquidity**: Pool is created on Uniswap V4 with equal amounts of base currency and EventTokens (1:1 initial price)
5. **Secondary Market**: Fans can trade EventTokens with dynamic fees (1% buy, 10% sell)

## üöÄ How It Works: Complete Example

### üìã Campaign Phase ($100k Target)

**Setup (using USDC as base currency):**

- **Target**: $100k USDC
- **Promoter Deposit**: $10k USDC (10% upfront)
- **Fans Contribute**: $120k USDC (100k target + 20k excess)

**Process:**

- **EventToken Minting**: 1:1 ratio with base currency contributed
  - $120k base currency raised ‚Üí 120k EventTokens minted to contributors
- **Campaign Success**: When 120% of target is reached, campaign finalizes

**Finalization:**

- **Protocol Fee**: $10k USDC (from promoter's deposit)
- **Net to Promoter**: $100k USDC (full target amount)
- **Pool Creation**: Equal amounts of $20k USDC + 20k EventTokens (theoretical 1:1 price, actual higher due to dynamic fees)

**Final Distribution:**

- **Contributors Hold**: 120k EventTokens
- **Pool Holds**: 20k EventTokens
- **Total Supply**: 140k EventTokens (fixed forever)

**Trading Dynamics:**

- **Dynamic Fees**: 1% buy fee, 10% sell fee (protects token value)
- **Buy Pressure**: Fans buy EventTokens with USDC
- **Sell Pressure**: Contributors sell EventTokens for USDC
